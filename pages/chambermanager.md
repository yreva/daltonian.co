## Overview

Chamber Manager is a robust, user-friendly software designed to streamline the process of managing and conducting experiments in controlled environments. This software is perfect for researchers, laboratory technicians, and anyone looking to precisely control the parameters of their experimental setups.

*If you are from outside of our group at UCI, welcome! This program is designed around the specific instruments we have in our lab. While it is effectively impossible that this configuration will match another research group's, feel free to reach out for help adapting it to your needs.*

## Features

- **User-Defined Experiments**: Easily define the metadata of your experiments all through a simple, intuitive interface.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your experiments with live data feeds. Get instant alerts if any parameter deviates from your predefined settings.
- **Data Logging and Export**: Automatically log all experiment data for further analysis. Export data in various formats for easy integration with other analytical tools.
- **Multi-Instrument Management**: Manage multiple instruments from a single interface, allowing for simultaneous control and monitoring of different experiments.

## Getting Started

To run the compiled version of the software, no additional installations are required. The compiled version is located on the SMSP computer in the lab.
