# TLDR

The ultrafast dynamics of 4-nitrocatechol suggest highly-efficient proton transfer in the excited state. This process occurs within a few picoseconds **in water**. Interestingly, this process also occurs in 2-propanol, a less efficient proton acceptor than water. These excited-state proton transfer processes may be the reason why 4-nitrocatechol has low photochemical yields.
