# TLDR

The ultrafast dynamics of 4-nitrocatechol suggest highly-efficient proton transfer in the excited state. This process occurs within a few picoseconds **in water**. Interestingly, this process also occurs in **2-propanol**, a less efficient proton acceptor. These excited-state proton transfer processes may be the reason why 4-nitrocatechol has low photochemical yields. 

# Motivations

Nitrophenols are strong light-absorbers in both the UV and Visible. This gives NPs the ability to absorb sunlight and undergo chemical transformations in the atmosphere.

They are known to photodegrade, but the electronic states responsible for photochemical reactions are not well characterized.

# Methods

Pump-probe experiments were conducted with a 340 nm pump pulse. Transient absorption was measured by varying the time delay between pump and probe pulses with a delay line. 
Spectra were produced via a spectrograph with a CCD detector.

Density functional theory calculations suggest that 4NC may reorient itself in the first excited singlet state (S<sub>1</sub>).
