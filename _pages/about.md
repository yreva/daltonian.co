<p>My name is Avery and I've always been fascinated by the science within nature. Growing up, I loved experimenting and learning about how things worked. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in chemistry at the University of North Florida. During the last two years of my undergraduate studies, I became heavily involved in research, exploring topics  from biochemistry to physical & computational chemistry.</p>

<p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I decided to take my passion for chemistry to the next level by pursuing graduate studies in physical chemistry. I moved to California to attend UC Irvine, where I currently am finishing out the last couple years of my PhD. Here, I have worked on several exciting research projects on the boundaries of atmospheric and physical chemistry, studying the effects of chemical environment on a select group of atmospheric polluatants (nitroaromatics).</p>

<p>Throughout my academic career, I have always enjoyed teaching and mentoring others. I've had the opportunity to work with several undergraduate students, sharing my knowledge and helping them develop their skills in chemistry research. I've also been involved in some outreach programs, working with a local high school to encourage students to pursue careers in science.</p>

<p>In recent years, I've become increasingly interested in the intersection of chemistry and data science. I believe that by combining these two fields, we can gain new insights into how chemicals interact and how we can better manage and analyze chemical data. I'm excited to continue exploring this area of research and see where it takes me.</p>

<p>Overall, my love for chemistry has driven me to pursue a career that allows me to combine my passions for research, teaching, and computer science. I hope to continue making meaningful contributions to the field and inspiring the next generation of scientists.</p>
